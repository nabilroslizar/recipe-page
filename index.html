    <h3>Preparation time</h3>

    <p>Total: Approximately 10 minutes</p>
    <p>Preparation: 5 minutes</p>
    <p>Cooking: 5 minutes</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>2-3 large eggs</p>
    <p>Salt, to taste</p>
    <p>Pepper, to taste</p>
    <p>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</p>
    <p>Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper
        until they are well mixed. You can add tablespoon of water or milk for a
        fluffier texture.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add
        butter or oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the
        eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are
        still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over
        one half of the omelette.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one
        edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then
        slide it onto a plate.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
    </ol>
